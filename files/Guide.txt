HOW TO:
When starting the game make sure that your webcam is placed on top
of your solitaire. To the left you'll see a live feed of the webcam
shown with an orange border. The areas in between these borders are
representing (from left to right) the Stoke, the Talon, the Foundations
and the Tableau. You must place your cards accordingly to these areas
to be sure our Solitaire solver works.
Around the corners of each card should be drawn a black box. This means
that the computer vision has identified the card and is now saved to that
pile. When you have your Solitaire and is ready to start the game, press
the button in the right corner called "update board". This button will
take the input from the live feed and transfer in on to the animated board
on the right. 
Make sure to check that every card is placed where it should be and is
the same card on both the live feed and the animated board =).

If one or more card is placed wrong press "Correct error on board".
This button will open a menu, where you in the top section select the
position of the wrong/missing card. In the middle section you select 
which card you want to correct and in the bottom section, you can click
the 3 buttons if you want to create a new card or remove a card.

When you are sure the animated board is in order, click the "Calculate
next move" button. This will calculate the optimal move to solve the
Solitaire.
Now you can move your physical cards accordingly to the animation and
when you are ready click the "Update board" button. Do this until you
win the game =) or lose the game =(

The last button called "Border settings" opens a menu where you can
toggle the border and change the vertical borders height.
